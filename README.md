                <p>Hi there, welcome to my page! My name is Nicole and I'm excited to share a little bit about 
                myself with you!</p></td>

   <hr>     
    <p>Professionally, I'm a senior technical recruiter with a passion for helping individuals find 
    their dream careers. I'm proud to be a certified diversity recruiter and certified technical 
    recruiter, which allows me to bring a unique perspective to the hiring process.  In addition 
    to my career in recruiting, I'm also a certified life coach and career coach. I believe in 
    empowering individuals to reach their full potential both personally and professionally.</p>
    <p>I keep busy outside of work too!  As a Reiki Master and aspiring Yogi, I'm always looking for 
    ways to deepen my spiritual practice. Believe it or not, I'm also a paranormal investigator - 
    I blame this on all the ghost stories and Scooby Doo cartoons I watched as a child! 
    I’m a dog Mom and when I'm not chasing ghosts, my dog and I love to hike and explore new trails.</p>
    <p>I love to travel and have a long list of places I’m planning to visit.  I’m a wine connoisseur and enjoy visiting different wineries and tasting events.
    I’m also bit of a crafter and enjoying making handmade gifts.</p>
    <p>I love to read and I’m a life-long learner.  Currently, I'm taking on a new challenge and 
    learning to code. I'm hoping to eventually transition into a developer role once I feel confident in my skills. It's a daunting task, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
    Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little bit about me!</p>
